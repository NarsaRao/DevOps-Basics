--- The idea of the Terminal Emulator is a program(App) that enables us to use terminal in a graphical environment
---To create the OS of your computer basically without graphical interaction
---shell is a CLI that takes command and converts and says to OS what to do
---ls in linux used to list directories and dir in windows
||| when a  command is typed then that command is applicable to present directory
---where command for searching for a particulat fiel
Ex:--dir *.docx /s lists down all the doc files in the curent directory and \s is subfolders which searche recursively
--- start commmand for opening  a file in the path that si currently on
\\\Environmnet Variables-Names values that used to change how processes and command are executed
EX:--example for the environment varibale echo %path% is a command to show the path presnts hence if any comman d is executing it sees if there is any searching file in teh path then only it executes
---pwd in linux prints present working directory not default in windows cd

in windows----dir /a-all files
          ----dir /a:h hidden files
           ----dir /a:s system files in linux as ls a 
          --- dir /s -all subfolders and fodler srecursively
 in linux ls -R
in windows start documents or folder name to open but in liux open
. means current ..means previous directoy
 ex-:  cd ../public means goes to previous directory haing public folder

Cat command stand for concatenate simple in linux where as in window it is type
  ---cat file.text // type file.txt
ombine files	cat f1 f2 > f3    	type f1 f2 > f3	
Append text	cat >> file.txt	     echo text >> file.txt	A
Number lines	cat -n file.txt


Man comamnd in linux used to know manual documentation of a command 
man==help in windpows

Demystyfying the command line
whats is command line: a user interface also called CLI that allows to utilise the fucntions of our os
works by means of typing  command instead of graphical user interface
because of some advantages over gui such as 1.file mgmt,2.control dev environment
3.automative repetative tasks
???file tree,create an ddlete,write and read
----create file-type nul>exmpla.txt --appemd type adding txt>>exaple.txr

----del file -del exkkple.txt
---cret edirectoory-mkdir ndnke
---dlete a direcory--rmdir name for empty
  and rmdir /s name for all subfolders

----write to files-echo this is a text line>example.txt
---and apend exho adding>> exmpale.txt
--reda using type ex.txt
